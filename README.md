## Description
The goal of this repository is to develop a real-time dual programming challenge platform where players can select a programming language of their choice, task difficulty, and challenge a friend. Then once both players have joined they compete side-by-side with real-time text-editors to complete several programming tasks. For every task completed players earn battle points and step closer to victory.

Some additional features of this platform are attacks that let player's disrupt/sabotage the other by spending their battle points. While these players fight to successfully complete all of their tasks first, spectators are welcome to view the programmers compete side-by-side.
